</div>

The Poisson equation is an integral part of many physical phenomena, yet its computation
is often time-consuming. This module presents an efficient method using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to rapidly solve arbitrary 2D Poisson
problems. Focusing on the 2D Poisson equation, the
method used in this module shows significant speed improvements over the finite difference
method while maintaining high accuracy in various test scenarios.

The improved efficiency comes from the possibility to pre-compute domain specific steps.
This means, for a given domain, the poisson equation can be efficiently solved for different source functions and boundary conditions.
The basic usage example below illustrates this.

This module comes with an easy-to-use method for solving arbitrary 2D Poisson problems.
It also includes a numerical solver and an analyzing function to quantify the results.
For visual inspection, the module offers a plotting function.

In its current version this module supports only 2D Poisson problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
The boundary conditions should be a constant value.

## Installation

This project is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip.

```bash
pip install fast-poisson-solver
```
Ensure that you have the latest version of pip; if you're unsure, you can upgrade pip with the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

You might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`, depending on your system.

## Basic Usage
The Fast Poisson Solver is designed to be highly adaptable and flexible. It can accept a variety of input formats, including lists, numpy arrays, and PyTorch tensors. Please note that currently, only 2D domains are supported.

The solver requires `x` and `y` coordinates for both the PDE domain and the boundary region. The order of these coordinates does not matter. For each pair of `x` and `y` coordinates, the PDE domain needs a value for the source function, and the boundary domain needs a value for the boundary condition.

Once the pre-computation for each domain and boundary region is done, it can be used for unlimited different source functions and boundary condition values.

Here is a basic example:

```python
from fast_poisson_solver import Solver

solver = Solver()
solver.precompute(x_pde, y_pde, x_bc, y_bc)

u_ml, u_ml_pde, u_ml_bc, f_ml, t_ml = solver.solve(f1, u_bc1)
u_ml, u_ml_pde, u_ml_bc, f_ml, t_ml = solver.solve(f2, u_bc2)
u_ml, u_ml_pde, u_ml_bc, f_ml, t_ml = solver.solve(f3, u_bc3)
# ...
```

Please replace x_pde, y_pde, x_bc, y_bc, f, and u_bc with your actual data or variables.

As the approach works best for coordinates that lie between 0 and 1, is it hard limited on this interval.
The order of the coordinates does not matter as long as the `x`, `y` and corresponding source term or value for the boundary condition match.
It is also not important for the coordinates to lie on a grid (Note: The numeric function needs a grid).
